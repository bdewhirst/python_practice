# Working through Practices of the Python Pro by Dane Hillard

## As of 2022-10-05:

This book allows me to refresh on coding best practices, etc. During my present job search, I'm not able to spend as much time coding as I'd like.

I'm working on chapter 7 and I've changed the visibility of the repo.

## As of 2022-09-23:
I'm picking this back up.


## As of 2020-02-15:
First, I'll review chapters 1-6, create a fresh environment, and test/fix the related code. Then, I'll work thru the remaining chapters.
